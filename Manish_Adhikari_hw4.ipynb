Lucky for you, we are providing the file containing the ratings -- ratings.dat  -- so all you need to do is loading the ratings.dat file in the notebook as a DataFrame variable using the Pandas library. The code to do this has been provided in the next cell, but you need to run it. The DataFrame variable is named as 'data_df'. The code names the column of movie id as 'MovieID', names the column of user id as 'UserID', names the column of rating as 'Rating', and the column of timestamp as 'Timestamp'. After this, the first 5 rows of data_df are printed out by DataFrame.head().\n",
